# Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project

This project leverages a Random Forest classifier to detect fraudulent activities. Implemented using Python, Flask, and HTML templates, it features a web-based interface for user interaction. Users input three features, and the system predicts whether the activity is fraudulent.

## Highlights

- *Random Forest Model:* Utilizes a robust Random Forest algorithm for high-accuracy fraud detection.
- *Flask Framework:* Provides a lightweight web framework for easy deployment and interaction.
- *Three Input Features:* Accepts three user-provided inputs to make predictions.
- *Secure Data Handling:* Ensures data security with HTTPS, encryption, and strict access controls.
- *Comprehensive Testing:* Includes unit, integration, and load testing for reliability and performance.

This project exemplifies a practical application of machine learning in fraud detection with a focus on security and usability.
